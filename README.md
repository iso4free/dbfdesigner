Simple and easy to use databasedesktop-like style editor for DBASE III+/CLIPPER/FOXPRO DBF files.

This project is no longer being developed due to the obsolescence of the use of .DBF files.

If anyone is interested in developing this project, feel free to use my work, crediting the original author.
